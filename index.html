                <h3>Ironeye</h3>
                <img src="https://img.gamewith.net/img/original_8a6df5dffc8687d20e4ff0897b119b45.png" alt="Ironeye"
                    width="600" height="300">
                <p>Ironeye is a long-range bow attacker with unlimited arrows.<br>
                    His skill “Marking” creates enemy weak points, making it easy to break their stance and land
                    critical.<br>
                    His passive “Eagle Eye” increases item drops for both himself and allies, helping the whole party
                    collect more loot.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="Top-2">
                <h3>Wylder</h3>
                <img src="https://img.gamewith.net/img/original_03483accc1069fb1dbf2976843822978.png" alt="Wylder"
                    width="600" height="300">
                <p>Wylder is a balanced attacker with strong survivability.<br>
                    Their passive “Sixth Sense” lets them cheat death once per battle, making them reliable in tough
                    fights.<br>
                    Wylder starts with Buckler Parry for early critical strikes.<br>
                    The ultimate skill, “Onslaught Stake,” delivers massive damage, breaks enemy stance, and keeps
                    Wylder protected with Vow of the Indomitable.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="Top-3">
                <h3>Executor</h3>
                <img src="https://img.gamewith.net/img/6c3b117b01b3424982dbd95920008e66.png" alt="Executor" width="600"
                    height="300">
                <p>Executor starts with a weapon that causes Blood Loss—great for quickly chipping away boss HP.<br>
                    With an S-rank Arcane stat, they boost all status effects, making Blood Loss even stronger.<br>
                    Their skill "Cursed Sword" allows well-timed parries to nullify attacks, rewarding skilled players
                    with big advantages in tough fights.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="Top-4">
                <h3>Duchess</h3>
                <img src="https://img.gamewith.net/img/3734710ceed02df04ca942d742fbe8e3.png" alt="Duchess" width="600"
                    height="300">
                <p>Duchess is a fast, agile attacker who can double-dodge with low stamina use and excels with rapid,
                    multi-hit weapons—especially those that inflict status effects.<br>
                    Her skill “Restage” copies recent actions for back-to-back big damage.<br>
                    The ultimate, “Finale,” makes the whole party invisible—even while attacking—perfect for surprise
                    attacks or safe revives.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
